#Apriori Algorithm C++

<b>First column is considered transaction id or simply id and thus always excluded. </b>

It does not show results for many columns (it takes a lot of time and moreover 
I can not seem to find the bug if it exists. I made another like this which only
works for integers but it takes a lot of time to generate combinations for many columns).

The output is detailed and it does a lot of filtering so that access to database is as low as possible.
