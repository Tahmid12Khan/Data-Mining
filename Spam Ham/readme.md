<h1>#Spam Ham Detection using Naive Bayes Classifier in C++ </h1> <br>
The codes are conducted according to the training file that has been provided (train.txt). "Spam Ham detection using Naive Bayes Classifier 1.cpp" and "Spam Ham detection using 
Naive Bayes Classifier 2" both codes are almost same. Different techniques have been used only in calculations and thus those show different 
results (accuracy, recall, F-measure etc). The differences can be seen in the main(), testing() and pWord() functions.
